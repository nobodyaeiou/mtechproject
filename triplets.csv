He is holding the cord of chariot with his full strength in left hand, which signifies the control of the time or kala, while the right hand shows tarjani mudra. He is a living personality of godhead. He is bedecked with princely attire. The style of painting is purely in Ajanta manner. He came down to earth to extend his grace and love to his devotees, to save the righteous and punish the wicked, to remove the evils and establish virtue.

Painting_2,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"A pioneer of the neo-tantric movement in south India, K. V. Haridasan's art arises from the blending of the rectilinear forms with the curvilinear, the positive and negative, bringing together opposites. The last find representation through the motifs of fire, petal and lotus, often amplified by the artist through his inclination towards the semiotics of the oval form. His most critically acclaimed series Brahmasutra, depicts these forms, in bright colours."
