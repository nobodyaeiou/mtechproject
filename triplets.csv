The playful sense of intimacy always comes as a pleasing surprise. This painting titled 'Black Horse' is one of the best paintings in the collection of the museum. The strong element of fantasy is enhanced by the use of rich Indian red in the background even as the artist has drawn the stylised horse using minimalist form."
Painting_3,MAIN_MATERIAL,Tempera on paper
Painting_3,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Jamini Roy was one of the earliest and most significant modernists of twentieth century Indian art. From 1920 onwards his search for the essence of form led him to experiment with dramatically different visual style. His career spanning over nearly six decades had many significant turning points and his works collectively speak of the nature of his modernism and the prominent role he played in breaking away from the art practices of his time. Trained in the British academic style of painting in the early decades of the twentieth century, Jamini Roy became well-known as a skilful portraitist. He received regular commissions after he graduated from the Government Art School in what is now Kolkata, in 1916. The first three decades of the twentieth century saw a sea-change in cultural expressions in Bengal. The growing surge of the nationalist movement was prompting all kinds of experiments in literature and the visual arts. The Bengal School, founded by Abanindranath Tagore and Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan under Nandalal Bose rejected European naturalism and the use of oil as a medium and were exploring new ways of representation. Jamini Roy, too, consciously rejected the style he had mastered during his academic training and from the early 1920s searched for forms that stirred the innermost recesses of his being. He sought inspiration from sources as diverse as East Asian calligraphy, terracotta temple friezes, objects from folk arts and crafts traditions and the like. What was increasingly apparent from 1920 onwards was that Roy brought a joy and"

Painting_3,DETAILED_DESCRIPTION,"Given the air of solemnity in his paintings, the touches of irony, playfulness and whimsy come as a pleasing surprise. The lighter touch is mostly manifest in his paintings of birds and beasts. For instance, the cat in the 'Cat and the Lobster' has its tail ending in a colourful trefoil. The 'Bird' has a witty perkiness. The solid presence of the 'Horse' is contrasted by the conceptual play of colours."

He graduated from the Govt. School of Art, Calcutta. Founded the 'Indian Academy of Art' in 1911. Atul Bose was awarded 'Guruprasanna Ghosh Scholarship' by the Calcutta University in 1923, which gave him scope for pursuing advanced course of study pertaining to European style of painting, at the Royal Academy of Art, London. He received the most prestigious award Ivory on 1926 completion of study there. Atul Bose will ever be regarded as a portraitist above anything else. Atul Bose is a realistic artist; 'Realism' has acquired its fullest meaning in his art. The technique the artist followed was Realistic Stream of Western Art. He had painted countless portraits of Indian National leaders. He completed another portrait of Rabindranath later - the last work in his life - which was in pastel. The duality of the manifest world - nature and life - has received sympathetic treatment in his hand. The warm attachment with nature may be viewed in 'Kanchanjangha Series', Mataharpur' and the river 'Padma'. Among some of his other remarkable paintings may be included 'The Ghat of Benaras', copied in 1932 from the original of Daniell, and 'Through my window' - the view of a cloudy monsoonal day which still summons a nostalgic feeling of the approaching rains. Atul Bose passed away on 10th July 1977."

A form that was used largely to illustrate manuscripts and texts, Rajput painting, in its essence, portrays a desire to depict human love. Love in the form of devotion, lust, courtship, passion, desire, or music can be witnessed through intricately detailed paintings that combine lyrical charm with a subtle narrative visual language. A painting done in the Rajput miniature style this painting shows a centrally located Lord Vishnu riding a Garuda - his vaahan or vehicle. On his lap is a seated woman -most likely to be his consort Lakshmi. Surrounding the Lord are eight standing male figure, painted in profile. The people seem to be moving as if in procession. Vishnu holds a bow and arrow, a sword like weapon, a conch in his many hands."

The aniconic and notational drawings of the Tantric Yantra, originally ritual designs for Tantric meditation, underwent a sea- change in his hand: the triangle became a pyramid, the circle a solid sphere, the square a cube which, in further constructivist elaboration, assumed the shape of a gem, emanating light. Born in Srinagar, Kashmir, Santosh was also an acclaimed mystic poet in Kashmiri, and wrote profusely in Urdu."

The shine of the brass lamp, the framed picture of Ganesha and the shadows on the wall create an intimate indoor scene. The woman in the picture was Haldankar’s daughter, Lilavati. The artist created a series of paintings with the sacred lamp as the central source of light. The series was called ‘Glow of Hope’ and Divine Flame is one the paintings of the series. Born in 1882, S L Haldankar was one of the last academic realists. He was trained at the JJ School of Art. Stalwarts such as MV Dhurandhar and Antonio Trinidade were among his mentors. He was a master portraitist, accomplished both in oils and watercolour. His landscapes in watercolour were particularly inspiring for many younger artists."

Tagore's emergence as a painter began in 1928 when he was 67 years old. Beginning with scratchings and erasures on the pages of his manuscripts during the mid-20s of the 20th Century, he slowly moved towards drawing and painting independent images. Between 1928 and 1940, Rabindranath painted more than 2000 images. He never gave any title to his paintings. Fed by memories and the subconscious, Rabindranath's art was spontaneous and dramatic. His images did not represent the phenomenal world but an interior reality. Rabindranath veered towards abstraction in his figuration. Expressionism in European art and the primitive art of ancient cultures inspired him. Fantasy, wild imagination and an innate feel for the absurd gave a distinctive character to his visual language. The National Gallery of Modern Art has a representative collection of his imagery."

Painting_21,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Scottish portrait painter and draughtsman, James Wales was born in Peterhead, Banffshire in 1747. At an early age he moved to Aberdeen and was educated at Marischal College. It was here that he also began to paint modest portraits on tin plates which were sold in Aberdeen. As an artist he was largely self-taught, and he benefited from the early patronage of Francis Peacock in Aberdeen. He married Margaret Wallace (1759-1795), daughter of William Wallace of Dundee and Annie nee Taylor. By 1783 Wales and his family had moved to London, where he is known to have exhibited at least three portraits at the Society of Artists by 1791, and three paintings at the Royal Academy between 1788 and 1789. An amateur artist and East India Company official named James Forbes (1749-1819) had sailed for Bombay as a Writer in 1765. In 1772 he was appointed Member of Council at Anjengo. In 1775 he officiated as chaplain, later secretary, attached to British forces sent to assist Raghunath Rao in the Maratha civil wars until ill-health forced him to embark for England on 1 December 1775. He returned to India in 1777, and served in Gujarat until increased Maratha military activity forced his evacuation in 1782. He travelled to the Malabar coast, then embarked for England, where they landed at Portsmouth on 17 July 1784. Many of his experiences formed the basis of a publication that he published at his own expense in four volumes between 1813 and 1815, entitled Oriental Memoirs. During his extended residency in India James Forbes had also made a significant number of watercolours of the Bombay area. When he returned to England in 1784 he commissioned James Wales to make paintings from two of his sketches. This commission helps to explain, in part, the subsequent decision by Wales to travel to Bombay. Wales applied to the East India Company for permission to work in Bombay in 1790, was granted permission on 5 January 1791, and arrived in Bombay on 15 July 1791. Here he was fortunate to receive commissions from a fellow Scot, (Patrick) Craufurd Bruce (1748-1820), one of the sons of Sir Michael Bruce, who served in the East India Company, and was later to become a banker in London. Although Bombay was a smaller and less affluent market than Calcutta or Madras for a British painter, Wales took the initiative and established himself in the small settlement, gradually gaining a reputation. Wales was fortunate enough in his first year to meet Sir Charles Warre Malet (1753-1815), the Political Resident at the Maratha court in Poona (from 1786 to 1797). Malet encouraged Wales to come to Poona and the first visit took place between July and December 1792. In addition to painting portraits for Malet, Wales painted a number of remarkable portraits of the Maratha chiefs and their ministers. In this regard Wales was highly influential for his role in introducing European art to the Maratha court, persuading the Peshwa to establish a school for drawing and negotiating the use of a ""Bungella"" for the display of works of art. Wales returned to Poona for a short time in 1793, again in September-October 1794, and finally, in January and April in 1795. The patronage of Malet and the Maratha court undoubtedly provided Wales with a steady source of income. In addition, in March 1793 Wales met the travelling artists Thomas and William Daniell, who encouraged him to continue his detailed drawings of Indian caves and temples.

Subramanyan uses his in-depth knowledge of various artistic traditions to create fantastical images of wit and eroticism that are universal in their appeal, yet coupled with iconic symbols drawn from Indian legends and folklore. There is a strong sense of folk narrativity in his paintings, as he translates, incidents, and folklore, into child-like drawings with an underlying hint of eroticism. He explored the possibilities of modern art from a different perspective, giving new dimensions to the human figure by making them appear more as characters from various myths and traditional narratives, populating a composition from a completely different angle."

Painting_24,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Amrita Sher-Gil flashed through the Indian artistic horizon like an incandescent meteor. Her place in the trajectory of Indian modern art is unquestionably pre eminent. Her aesthetic sensibility shows not surprisingly a blend of European and Indian elements. Her command over handling of oil medium and use of colour, as well as her vigorous brushwork and strong feeling for composition, all go towards giving a dazzling quality to her genius. Sher-Gil's sikh father, Umrao Singh Sher-Gil was an owner of landed estates and among other things, he was also a skilled photographer. Her mother, Marie Antoinette was a Hungarian. Sher- Gil's art education was completed in Paris where she was influenced by the post impressionists like Gauguin. While her childhood years were spent travelling between India and Europe, she returned to India in the mid 30s of the 20th century with a wish to make India her home. It was at this time her ways of seeing changed radically. Sher-Gil looked at the Indian art traditions with a fresh eye and she gazed at the sad-eyed people around her with empathy. She became excited by the Indian miniature traditions and as a consequence of her travels to the rock cut caves of Ajanta and Ellora and through South India, her visual language underwent a dramatic transformation. Both the palette, which became saturated with intense reds, ochres, browns, yellows and greens, and her figuration expressed a new visual reality. But she interspersed these paintings of her land and its people with paintings that she practiced in Paris. It is interesting to note that in the mid-1930s, when Amrita Sher-Gil explored a new expressive style to represent the Indian themes that she painted, there was a lot of experimental work going on at the time. Rabindranath Tagore had already exhibited his expressionist style of painting in Europe and was vigorously continuing to paint haunting images. Jamini Roy was drawing critical attention with his folk idiom and the Santiniketan masters were engaged in making bold experiments with visual language. The dichotomy is perhaps one clue to her complex persona. Sher-Gil was passionate about life drinking what it had to offer to the dregs. And yet she harboured within her a deep sense of melancholy that found expression in the pensive faces of her subjects and their languorous poses. Sher-Gil's visual language introduced a host of new elements in modern Indian art. For one, her handling of the oil medium opened up new possibilities for a future generation of artists. Her distinctive vision left its mark on pre-Independence modern painting. Art historian and cultural studies analyst Geeta Kapur observed that she had feminized Indian art. Her female forms demanded attention. They were both sensuous and vulnerable. They were subjects and objects at the same time. Besides her subtly expressive representation of the female figure, Sher-Gil also wove in ingeniously narrative elements of miniature paintings in her work. Also,for the first time, we see intimate portrayals of domestic scenes. The NGMA has a large collection of 107 of her paintings covering an extensive range of her important works both from her Paris days and from her Indian stay."

Painting_26,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Known primarily as a painter of portraits, conversation pieces and theatrical subjects, Zoffany was born in Frankfurt, Germany, the son of an architect and court cabinet maker. He enjoyed court patronage throughout his career. Upon completion of his apprenticeship, he made the first of two trips to Rome in 1750, studying with the portrait painter Masucci. Zoffany arrived in England around 1760 and worked for some time as a drapery painter in the studio of Benjamin Wilson (1721-88), a minor portraitist. His career in England was established when the actor-manager David Garrick became his first major English patron. Zoffany painted four conversation pieces of the Garrick household in 1762, as well as numerous theatrical pictures which brought him to the attention of the public and, more importantly, Queen Charlotte, who became his patron. Zoffany exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1762 to 1769. He was nominated by George III for membership in the Royal Academy in 1769, exhibiting there from 1770 to 1800. Between 1772 and 1778 he worked primarily in Florence, where he painted The Interior of the Tribuna at Florence (Royal Collection). He returned to London in 1779 but, after a falling out with the King and Queen over his Tribuna, went to India in 1783, remaining there until 1789. He died at his home at Strand-on-the-Green and is buried in Kew Churchyard near London."

Painting_27,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"In this painting, 'Homage to Van Gogh', Paritosh Sen portrays a seated Van Gogh, posing for the artist, with a bandage across his infamous ear. As he sits, smoking a pipe, staring towards the viewer, Sen has depicted himself, painting Van Gogh on a canvas that is half shown. On it, we see an image of Christ, and not Van Gogh, while Sen himself stares at Van Gogh in rapture. The intent could be to evoke the godly status that Van Gogh had risen to, and perhaps the artist himself wishes that one day he will achieve that. The human figure dominates Sen's artwork and recurrent subject in Sen's works is his depiction of scenes from everyday urban life. His style of representation is influenced by his exposure to Western Modern art, and has traces of cubism. He uses two dimensional, structured planes but still creates an illusion of voluptuousness. A painter, illustrator, tutor and writer, Paritosh Sen has been a part of the world of Indian art, for close to four decades now. Founder of the Calcutta Group in the 1940s, prior to the existence of a Progressive Artists group, his art is rendered from a cynical and detached perspective, which is typically Sen's viewpoint."

There were four major school under the Rajput miniatures. They being, Mewar school which consists regional styles like the Nathdwara, Devgarh, Udaipur. etc; the Marwar school comprising of the Kishangarh, Jodhpur and Bikaner styles; Hadoti school consisting of Kota, Bundi and Jhalawar styles; and the other styles from the regions like Jaipur and Shekhawati. The Pahari school comprising of the Basoli, Kangra and other styles of miniature paintings was also out sprout of the Rajput miniatures. Considering the themes, the Pajput miniatures have the episodes from the epics, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, hunting and war scenes, and portraits in a very ornatamental style depicted in them. Each school and artistic style paints the themes with their unique style, like the different dialects of the same language."

In 1773 he was appointed the first chief justice of the new supreme court at Calcutta, and in 1775 presided at the trial of Nandakumar for forgery, with which his name has been chiefly connected in history. His impeachment was unsuccessfully attempted in the House of Commons in 1787, and he is accused by Macaulay of conspiring with Hastings to commit a judicial murder; but the whole question of the trial of Nandakumar has been examined in detail by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, who states that ""no man ever had, or could have, a fairer trial than Nuncomar, and Impey in particular behaved with absolute fairness and as much indulgence as was compatible with his duty."""

N S Bendre also worked in the company of Nandalal Bose, Ram Kinkar Baij and Benod Behari Mukherjee during his stay in Santiniketan as an Artist in Residence in the year 1945. An ardent traveller, Bendre made a journey in 1947-48 to USA, Europe and other foreign countries getting acquainted with the works of modern masters of the West. The artist then experimented with cubism and expressionism assimilating them with traditional Indian classical and folk art styles. In his later years, in the 1960s, Bendre adopted the neo impressionistic technique of pointillism in his works eliminating the details and paying more attention to creating an overall sensory experience in his compositions. N S Bendre joined the Progressive Artists Group, Bombay in 1948. He started teaching at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda in 1950 and later became the Dean of the Faculty of Painting in 1959.

Painting_38,MAIN_MATERIAL,Tempera on canvas
Painting_38,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Jamini Roy was one of the earliest and most significant modernists of twentieth century Indian art. From 1920 onwards his search for the essence of form led him to experiment with dramatically different visual styles. His career spanning over nearly six decades had many significant turning points and his works collectively speak of the nature of his modernism and the prominent role he played in breaking away from the art practices of his time. Trained in the British academic style of painting in the early decades of the twentieth century, Jamini Roy became well-known as a skilful portraitist. He received regular commissions after he graduated from the Government Art School in what is now Kolkata, in 1916. The first three decades of the twentieth century saw a sea-change in cultural expressions in Bengal. The growing surge of the nationalist movement was prompting all kinds of experiments in literature and the visual arts. The Bengal School, founded by Abanindranath Tagore and Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan under Nandalal Bose rejected European naturalism and the use of oil as a medium and were exploring new ways of representation. Jamini Roy, too, consciously rejected the style he had mastered during his academic training and from the early 1920s searched for forms that stirred the innermost recesses of his being. He sought inspiration from sources as diverse as East Asian calligraphy, terracotta temple friezes, objects from folk arts and crafts traditions and the like."

He trained at Nutan Kala Mandir (Mumbai) between 1935 and 1940 under G. S. Dandavatimath, the revered mentor from North Karnataka. Almelkar later joined Sir J. J. School of Art, Mumbai to pursue his passion. His early works were influenced by the oeuvre of Walter Langhammer and N.S. Bendre. However, from 1955 onwards, he evolved his own style. While Almelkars contemporaries were adherents of the Progressive School, he remained rooted to the traditional style of art, even though his art was often termed as clichéd. He often painted on cardboard applying colours with his bare fingers instead of the brush. He did not desist from using jute, cotton rags, discarded combs and toothbrushes for applying colours. The final touch was in the form of fine lines of black waterproof ink. He was a recipient of several awards such as the Gold Medal of Bombay Art Society and the Lalit Kala Academy Award. He held about 40 solo exhibitions both in India and abroad."

Painting_41,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"Mohan Samant studied Basholi miniature painting under M. Palsikar in his early artistic endevours. In the 50s, Samant joined the Progressive Artists' Group (PAG). While his fellow PAGs took their inspiration predominately from Paris, Samant explored the imagery of Egyptian funerary wall drawings, Ajanta murals and Rajput miniatures, establishing a range of primeval images in his work. He describes his art as ""almost like installation art; only difference being that my installation is within my frame."" His paintings are primarily abstract, but retain figurative aspects that often recreate mythic narratives. One of the most intriguing aspects of Samant's paintings is his use of texture: manipulation of paint materials with sand and glue in the early 1960's, paper cutouts attached to the canvas in the 1970's and the application of wire drawings in the 1980's."

Each kingdom has its unique style and features and could be distinguished from the other depending on it visual composition, use of lines and colours defining the forms and the figures in the painting, the medium, etc. With these distinctions each style formed into a different school and each school further had several artists styles and substyles. There were four major school under the Rajput miniatures. They being, Mewar school which consists regional styles like the Nathdwara, Devgarh, Udaipur. etc; the Marwar school comprising of the Kishangarh, Jodhpur and Bikaner styles; Hadoti school consisting of Kota, Bundi and Jhalawar styles; and the other styles from the regions like Jaipur and Shekhawati. The Pahari school comprising of the Basoli, Kangra and other styles of miniature paintings was also out sprout of the Rajput miniatures. Considering the themes, the Pajput miniatures have the episodes from the epics, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, hunting and war scenes, and portraits in a very ornatamental style depicted in them. Each school and artistic style paints the themes with their unique style, like the different dialects of the same language."

Painting_46,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"Asit Kumar Haldar was born in Jorasanko, a grand-nephew of Rabindranath. He designed sets and introduced alpana patterns as a form of decoration. He also illustrated a limited edition of Gitanjali. Perhaps the most significant contribution came when he, along with some other artists, was commissioned by the Indian Society of London to copy the paintings in the Ajanta Caves. The technique of painting murals and narrating a tale with the brush were something a new experience. Enriched, Haldar incorporated these into his work to achieve a wonderful life-like effect and his canvases attracted worldwide attention. Haldar worked with equal ease in oil, tempera, watercolors and a special technique that he developed called 'lacit'-lacquered painting on wood. Drawing upon the rich cultural heritage of India, Haldar painted a whole series of 32 paintings based on the Buddha. Thirty canvases formed a collection of episodes from Indian history and he also illustrated Omar Khayyam's verses."

Painting_47,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Jamini Roy was one of the earliest and most significant modernists of twentieth century Indian art. From 1920 onwards his search for the essence of form led him to experiment with dramatically different visual style. His career spanning over nearly six decades had many significant turning points and his works collectively speak of the nature of his modernism and the prominent role he played in breaking away from the art practices of his time. Trained in the British academic style of painting in the early decades of the twentieth century, Jamini Roy became well-known as a skilful portraitist. He received regular commissions after he graduated from the Government Art School in what is now Kolkata, in 1916. The first three decades of the twentieth century saw a sea-change in cultural expressions in Bengal. The growing surge of the nationalist movement was prompting all kinds of experiments in literature and the visual arts. The Bengal School, founded by Abanindranath Tagore and Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan under Nandalal Bose rejected European naturalism and the use of oil as a medium and were exploring new ways of representation. Jamini Roy, too, consciously rejected the style he had mastered during his academic training and from the early 1920s searched for forms that stirred the innermost recesses of his being. He sought inspiration from sources as diverse as East Asian calligraphy, terracotta temple friezes, objects from folk arts and crafts traditions and the like. What was increasingly apparent from 1920 onwards was that Roy brought a joy and"

Painting_55,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"The series of images depicting the life of Jesus Christ is perhaps one of the boldest experiments in figuration and narrativisation by Jamini Roy. The language of the Christ paintings is remarkable as Roy invests the grave, contemplative faces in their somewhat hieratic poses with iconicity. In this particular painting, the artist has depicted the crucifixion of Christ with a bright colour palette that offsets the solemn theme of the painting. Roy infuses the imagery with a strong sense of geometricity, that reduces forms to their bare essentials in the composition. There is also the suggestion of a sacred presence in the mass of worshipping figures in the background."

On the one hand those times were marked by the revivalist environment with a strong swadesi bent, and on the other, in some of the individual artists at least, one could sense an increasing yearning for a wider exploration of the arts in both terms of style and technique."

The impact of this influence is evident in this painting, wherein the eyes of the central figure are painted in the same half-closed manner with a lyrical quality. Many of the artists of the Bengal school found it important to imitate this stylistic language as an allegiance towards an ancient tradition. Nandalal Bose, sketched animals, domestic activities like pooja's, festival worship and the landscapes he saw around him. While not an expressly political artist, Nandalal Bose made sketching a regular part of his quest to reaching simplicity in his art. Nandalal's exploration of the sensory uniqueness of the world around him is even more visible in his drawings."

The Pahari school comprising of the Basoli, Kangra and other styles of miniature paintings was also out sprout of the Rajput miniatures. Considering the themes, the Pajput miniatures have the episodes from the epics, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, hunting and war scenes, and portraits in a very ornatamental style depicted in them.

Painting_71,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"A sensitive artist,P.T Reddy evolved a unique vision of his own, creating complex compositions, realistic and expressionistic portraits, still-lifes and impressionistic landscapes. His later works are abstract, often revealing a tantric influence with folk motifs and symbols, and a synthesis of almost contrary forms. As an artist, Reddy interprets the traditional Tantra philosophy and at the same time deals with contemporary themes. For both neo- tantric artists and Western modernists, the tension between the spiritual and the material found expression through symbols that defied particular iconographic or culturally-grounded systems and instead evoked broader universal expressions of spirituality, patterns in the universe, and sense perception. Reddy's use of symbols, connection to a spiritual system in tantra, and interpretation of sound all play into similar ideas. Reddy came from a poor family of agriculturists, who strongly opposed his choice to make art his professional practice. Defying his family's wishes, Reddy joined the J. J. School of Arts, Bombay to study painting under a scholarship. Here he was also trained in mural design and was acquainted with the Rajput and Pahari miniature styles."

He started his artistic career as a landscape painter, taking inspiration from the Western impressionists artists. Slowly he moved to a more indigenous language, where he took impetus from classical Indian miniatures and ancient murals. Also inspired by the works of N. S. Bendre and Walter Langhammer and folk art traditions in the 1940s, Almelkar employed simplicity with regard to the use of color in his compositions. The use of rhythmic, bold lines can be clearly seen as an influence of Indian miniatures in his works. He tried to merge Indian themes with modern techniques giving them an undertone of traditional folk art. He used detailed figurative and naturalistic drawings to narrate mythological stories and subjects. He also served as the Principal of a private art school, Nutan Kala Mandir in Mumbai. He also joined J. J. School of Art as a lecturer in 1968. He was also invited as State Guest to Malaysia to deliver several lectures. In 1954, he received a Gold Medal from the Bombay Art Society, Mumbai. He was also honored with the Governor's Prize from Bombay Art Society Diamond Jubilee Exhibition, Mumbai in 1948. He participated in several solo as well as group shows in India as well as abroad including Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand. In his lifetime, he received from over twenty gold medals, twenty four silver medals & several cash prizes."

Painting_81,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"A.Ramachandran is one of India's most distinguished and prolific artists who has ceaselessly experimented with visual language for more than four decades. Painter, sculptor, graphic artist, designer, and art educationist, Ramachandran has explored diverse mediums and scales, with a dynamic personal vision and distinctive artistic style. Deeply influenced by the prevalent socio-political situation in Kerala, his early works represented oppression, violence, war, social imagery, re-enacting themes of exploitation, oppression, war, human brutality, and political violence. Human figures were dismembered, most of them headless. Several aspects of Indian classical art have been integrated into his art, including compound motifs and imagery, decorative elements along the exuberance of forms and colours. Ramachandran believes that his monumental painting 'Yayati' was one of the landmarks in his growth as an artist because it allowed him to incorporate elements of classical proportions and postures in his work. A decorative element much like the murals is observed in many of his paintings. However, in most of his works, the decorative element does not stand out; it is intrinsic, built into his figures' clothes and jewelry as a part of the overall design."

Painting_82,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Raja Ravi Varma was born into an aristocratic family in Kerala. Raja Ravi Varma was largely a self taught artist as European techniques go. But there is no denying that Raja Ravi Varma was a master at handling the oil medium and achieved a magical ease with European naturalism. While Raja Ravi Varma stood at the transitional stage between Indian painting tradition and the emergence of Salon artist well versed in European academic naturalism he reconciled the aesthetic principles of both in his style. He represented the Hindu mythological stories so loved by the Indian imagination, with an illusionistic flair that mirrored the society of his time. According to art historians, Raja Ravi Varma's dramatic history paintings influenced the pioneers of Indian cinema like Dadasaheb Phadke and Baburao Painter. Raja Ravi Varma excelled as a portrait painter as well as a painter of various other genres like history painting, painting of female figures and so on. He travelled through length and breadth of India seeking portrait and other commissions. He established a press with German technology so that inexpensive oleographs could be made to cater to a mass demand. So briskly did the prints sell that they left a deep impression on popular visual culture even to this day."

Painting_94,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"His attitude was never of a professional artist's. He painted and involved himself in folk traditions to satisfy his own creative urges. In fact, he never held an exhibition of his works while he lived. Born in Orissa in 1908, but moving on to Bihar in 1931, Maharathi's stays at various places were marked by ""a couple of private hours in the morning, when he would lock himself up in a room and just paint."" He was deeply influenced by the artistic idiom of the Bengal School. And, several other influences contributed to the process of his artistic growth: for instance, Orissa's folk art and culture, Madhubani paintings, the tribal art of Chhotanagpur. He wasn't a romantic who lived in the cocoon of his own creations while delinked from the cadence of the world outside. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, he involved himself with the textile industry, creating elegant artistic designs in the process. He worked with wood, bamboo and other similar materials, using them with his aesthetic sense to develop creations with heightened levels of beauty and charm."

Painting_95,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"Raja Ravi Varma was a prolific artist, but so popular that he could often not meet the demands of his patrons. So, his younger brother, Raja Raja Varma, would often help him finish a painting. According to art historians, while Raja Ravi Varma excelled in portraitures, landscape was his younger brother’s forte. The two brothers would often travel by boat at night time, soaking in the quiet atmosphere, the reflection of the moon on the water, or when it disappeared behind a cloud. Silhouetted against the light are trees and distant groves. A woman sits by the glimmering water.   Raja Ravi Varma was a master of realism. This realism was often heightened in his oil paintings by the way he portrayed light and texture. In most of his paintings, for instance, the jewellery worn by the subject is so accurately painted that one can even tell the type of pearls the person is wearing."

This painting of ‘Saraswati’ is lavishly ornamented with gold and silver leaf but is nevertheless subtle in its effect.

She wears a full arm blouse, typical of a middle class Parsi woman, that has a pink ribbon at the collar. The folds of the cloth, the lighting of the face, and spectacles shows the srtists skill in portrait painting as well as western realism. From the attire and the facial features we can say that the lady in the portrait resembles a typical traditional Parsi woman. Manchershaw F. Pithawala (1872-1937) was a trained academic realist Indian painter and was a student of John Griffiths at Sir J. J School of Art in Mumbai. Acclaimed as a portraitist his art work depicts his acute observation of Western naturalism, and realistic portrait making. His understanding of techniques such as; chiaroscuro, color gradation, opacity, and layering reflects a rigorous training under a formal art institution that based itself on a Western model of art making."

Painting_116,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"1887-1972 He was honoured with the State award of Padma Bhushan in 1955. He was one of the most famous pupils of Abanindranath Tagore, whose contribution to the emergence of modern art in India remains unquestionable. Born on April 11, 1887 into a moderately prosperous family of land-owners in a village Beliatore in the Bankura district, West Bengal. His new style was a reaction against the Bengal School and Western tradition. His underlying quest was threefold: to capture the essence of simplicity embodied in the life of the folk people; to make art accessible to a wider section of people; and to give Indian art its own identity. Jamini Roy's paintings were put on exhibition for the first time in the British India Street of Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1938. During the 1940s, his popularity touched new highs, with the Bengali middle class and the European community becoming his main clientele. In 1946, his work was exhibited in London and in 1953, in the New York City. He spent most of his life living and working in Calcutta. Initially he experimented with Kalighat paintings but found that it has ceased to be strictly a ""patua"" and went to learn from village patuas. Consequently his techniques as well as subject matter were influenced by traditional art of Bengal. He preferred himself to be called a patua. Jamini Roy died in 1972. He was survived by four sons and a daughter. Currently his successors (daughters-in-law and grand children and their children) stay at the home he had built in Ballygunge Place, Kolkata. His works can be found in various galleries across the globe as well as in his home. It is evident that his followers and successors copied many of his works with a minor variations intentional or unintentional. So, the basic problem lies with the identification of the originality of his works."

Although the colonial regime did not embark upon a systematic transformation of Indian taste through Western art schools until the 1850's, the ""high noon"" of empire, British taste had begin to infiltrate Indian aristocratic patronage form as early as the end of the 18th century. The first sign of change was the loss of courtly patronage in India with the fall of the Indian powers in the late 18th century."

Painting_118,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"Jamini Roy drew imagery using a simplification of form inspired by the folk arts of the Bengal region that had evolved over the centuries. In this painting the artist has adopted the tribhanga or the bent axis pose from traditional iconography in the representation of the figure of the Gopini or milkmaid. The artist has adhered to the notions of ideal feminine beauty with the depiction of the doe eyes, demure stances and the voluptuous figure of the Gopini with a heightened pliancy in her figuration. There is a strong element of fantasy in the richly saturated palette that Roy has used particularly for the Krishna-Leela series of works. In keeping with the theme, the imagery is invested with a playful iconicity."
Painting_118,MAIN_MATERIAL,Tempera on cloth
Painting_118,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Jamini Roy was one of the earliest and most significant modernists of twentieth century Indian art. From 1920 onwards his search for the essence of form led him to experiment with dramatically different visual style. His career spanning over nearly six decades had many significant turning points and his works collectively speak of the nature of his modernism and the prominent role he played in breaking away from the art practices of his time. Trained in the British academic style of painting in the early decades of the twentieth century, Jamini Roy became well-known as a skilful portraitist. He received regular commissions after he graduated from the Government Art School in what is now Kolkata, in 1916. The first three decades of the twentieth century saw a sea-change in cultural expressions in Bengal. The growing surge of the nationalist movement was prompting all kinds of experiments in literature and the visual arts. The Bengal School, founded by Abanindranath Tagore and Kala Bhavana in Santiniketan under Nandalal Bose rejected European naturalism and the use of oil as a medium and were exploring new ways of representation. Jamini Roy, too, consciously rejected the style he had mastered during his academic training and from the early 1920s searched for forms that stirred the innermost recesses of his being. He sought inspiration from sources as diverse as East Asian calligraphy, terracotta temple friezes, objects from folk arts and crafts traditions and the like."

Painting_118,DETAILED_DESCRIPTION,"From the end 1920s, Jamini Roy rejected the European oil medium and began to use traditional pigments from vegetable and mineral sources and the imagery was drawn from village life. He invested the peasants, artisans, followers of religious cults, village women and adivasis with immense dignity. He represented in his paintings what they held sacred. He painted from folk tales and narratives that permeated the rural consciousness."

Painting_122,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"A.Ramachandran is one of India's most distinguished and prolific artists who has ceaselessly experimented with visual language for more than four decades. Painter, sculptor, graphic artist, designer and art educationist, Ramachandran has explored diverse mediums and scales, with a dynamic personal vision and distinctive artistic style. Deeply influenced by the prevalent socio-political situation in Kerala, his early works represented oppression, violence, war, social imagery, re-enacting themes of exploitation, oppression, war, human brutality, and political violence. Human figures were dismembered, most of them headless. Several aspects of Indian classical art have been integrated into his art, including compound motifs and imagery, decorative elements along with the exuberance of forms and colours. Ramachandran believes that his monumental painting 'Yayati' was one of the landmarks in his growth as an artist, because it allowed him to incorporate elements of classical proportions and postures in his work. A decorative element much like the murals is observed in many of his paintings. However, in most of his works, the decorative element does not stand out; it is intrinsic, built into his figures' clothes and jewellery as a part of the overall design."

Painting_123,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"Kalpathi Ganpathi Subramanyan was born on 15th February, 1924, in Kuthuparambu in North Kerala. A graduate in Economics, Subramanyan went to Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan, to study under the apprenticeship of Benodebehari Mukherjee, Nandalal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij at Santiniketan in 1944. He also went to Slade School of Art at the University of London under British Council Research Fellowship in 1955. Subramanayan, is known among his contemporaries and peers for his familiarity and his ability to work with diverse media such as iron sheets, watercolour, gouache, oil, acrylic, relief murals on panels, fabrics and terracotta. These qualities were nurtured by him through an invigorating study of the works of Ananda Coomarswamy, known for advocating cultural resurgence in the post-independence era and instilling pride in the country's heritage. The larger cultural perspective invoked in his works is suggestive of the contemporary life and reality that surrounds him. His works reflect the inner, sometimes decorative facets that joyfully emerge from the strange interplay of passion and ordering can be regarded as a celebration of life in all its forms. His work also suggest insightful links with the European context of modernism with an added awareness of the varied legacies of Indian tradition and the complexities of the Indian present; and is further enriched through his understanding of other performing arts. Subramanyan taught as a Professor in painting in Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda and also served as their Dean from 1968-74. He went back to teach in Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan in the Painting Department in 1980. In 1989, he was designated as a Professor Emeritus of Visva Bharati. Subramanyan's work has travelled and exhibited in solo shows as well as in joint ventures all over the world. Subramanyan has authored many books on art and also illustrated and authored fictional stories for children. K. G. Subramanyan was honoured with Padma Vibhushan in 2012, Padma Bhushan in 2006 and Padma Shri in 1975 by the President of India."

Painting_133,ARTIST'S_LIFE_DATE_/_BIO_DATA,"The most important Russian Orientalist of the 19th century, Vasily Vereshchagin is a unique figure in the history of Russian art. The combination of his superlative talent, academic rigour, and humanitarian concern resulted in an unparalleled life's work of paintings. In 1874 Vasily Vereshchagin forsook his native Russia for India, where he was to remain for almost two years gathering ethnographic materials with which to colour an intended series of paintings devoted to the region. The works inspired by his time in India are extraordinarily beautiful and accomplished. He travelled extensively, his reverence for this rich land foreshadowing that of another Russian artist and Nobel Peace Prize nominee, Nicholas Roerich (1874-1947). Encounters with wild animals, almost drowning in a river, freezing on a mountain ledge and being plagued with tropical malaria did little to dampen his enthusiasm; his fervent interest in every aspect of local life roused the suspicions of the English colonial authorities who quickly, and somewhat ironically, became convinced he was spying for the homeland he had been obliged to quit. During his time in India Vereshchagin was deeply moved by what he perceived to be the plight of a great and ancient people at the hands of the British colonialists and determined to address the matter."

Hailing from Kerala, the aristocratic Raja Ravi Varma made Bombay his home for over a decade. Self-taught , Varma had learned by watching European painters, sought with equal enthusiasm by the Raj and the Indian aristocracy. What ensured Varma's enduring fame was his innovation in the genre of history painting in India, applying Victorian academic art to ancient Indian epics and literary classics. In addition, Ravi Varma reconfigured the whole print culture by introducing a striking illusionist iconography based on his history paintings and by producing high quality reproductions."

Painting_140,BRIEF_DESCRIPTION,"This painting shows Goddess Ganga is sitting on makara on padmasana. The word Ganga etymologically means that which emerges (ga) from the sky (gam). She is divine river that flows down to the earth from the heaven. Ganga water has always been considered as liquid medicine(Gangani pathyam or Himavat prabhava pathyah punya). She is considered sacred. Personified as a goddess, Ganga is worshiped by Hindus who believe that bathing in the river causes the remission of sins and facilitaes liberation from the cycle of life and death. Pilgrims travel long distances to immerse the ashes of their kin in the waters of ganges, bringing their sprits closer to nirvana. There are several beliefs that give various versions of the birth of Ganga. According to one version, the sacred water in Brahma's Kamandalu (water vessel) became personified as a maiden, Ganga. According to Vaishnavite legend, Brahma had reverently washed the feet of Vishnu and collected this water in his Kamandalu. According to yet a third version, Ganga was the daughter of Himvat, king of the mountains, and his consort Mena; she was thus a sister of the goddess Parvati. Every version declares that she was raised in the heavens, under the tutelage of Brahma."
